For a given a binary tree of integers and an integer X, find and return the total number of nodes of the given binary tree which are having data greater than X.
Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains an integer, denoting the value of X.

public class Solution {


	public static int countNodesGreaterThanX(BinaryTreeNode<Integer> root, int x)
	 {
	 if ( root == null )
	  {
    return 0;
      }

  int countLeft =countNodesGreaterThanX(root.left, x);
  int countRight = countNodesGreaterThanX(root.right, x);

  return  (root.data > x ? 1 : 0)+countLeft + countRight;
}
	 }
