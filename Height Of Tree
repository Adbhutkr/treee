For a given Binary Tree of integers, find and return the height of the tree.
Example:
                        10
                      /      \
                    20      30
                   /    \
                 40    50

Height of the given tree is 3. 

Height is defined as the total number of nodes along the longest path from the root to any of the leaf node.

*
	
	Following is the structure used to represent the Binary Tree Node

	class BinaryTreeNode<T> {
		T data;
		BinaryTreeNode<T> left;
		BinaryTreeNode<T> right;

		public BinaryTreeNode(T data) {
			this.data = data;
			this.left = null;
			this.right = null;
		}
	}

 */

public class Solution {

	public static int height(BinaryTreeNode<Integer> root) 
	{
	if (root == null)
	{
		return 0 ;
	}
      int lefttree =  height(root.left);
	  int righttree = height(root.right);

	  return (lefttree>righttree ? lefttree : righttree)+1;
	}
	

}
